          I am an upcoming senior at Orange High School and plan to major in computer science in college. I have had experience with computers and programming for many years. This website showcases some of the oldest and most recent projects I have done. In addition to independent study, I also take computer science classes at my local college (TRI-C) while in school. I have a passion for technology and hope I can continue to learn more even after school ends.
        </span>-->

        <!--<span>I am a highschooler in Ohio and I am constantly learning more and more through various coding projects.
        Like most people I started with Scratch making small projects with my friends when I was around 10.
        When I was 11, I went to a coding camp where I got an introduction to c++ and learned most major programming
        functions. I fiddled with it for a few years and then began learning web development with html, css, and js.
        My sophmore year in Highschool I took my first real AP Java class and began modding for minecraft along with making
        some machine learning projects using neural networks. Over that winter I expanded to node js and started learning
        more server side methods in programming. This is where most of the Web Accessible Projects came from.
        After having taken all the available courses in my school for coding I took a C/C++ class through CCP at Tri-C.
          Since then I havetaken c++/C and data structures and algorithems using java. Spending a lot of time in first
          robotics at school gave me experience with machining and hardware components computer programs can interact with. During my
          sophmore summer I interned at an engineering company called IDT where I learned Solid Works. The following summer I
        Worked for a local landscaper to earn money for a car. Most of all I have a passion for computer science and programming.
        I can work for hours without getting bored. Outside of work I hope to be able to work on personal projects to advance
        my knowledge and understanding of this technology even more. The feeling of creating something is unique and this satisfaction
        is most prominent for me with computer science and stem activities.</span>-->
